# Team-Fortress-2-Hit-Sounds-Minimal-
This plugin adds all the hit sound from Team-Fortress 2. They are played when you do damage to a player. The plugin also adds the "krit sound", which is played when you hit someone in the head, as well as "killstreak sound", when you kill 5 players in a row. Every player can set a different sound, to disable an option or to completely disable the plugin.
